# User Story
Role: FinTech Consulting Firm

Goal: The project goal is to build a tool to help credit union members evaluate their financial health. The tool should enable the following: 
      First, they should be able to assess their monthly budgets. 
      Second, they should be able to forecast a reasonably effective retirement plan based on their current holdings of cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds. 

Reason: The credit union focus is on projects to benefit local communities offering them the opportunity to achieve the following:
      1.	A tool that will enable members to determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.
      2.	A financial planner for forecasting the performance of their retirement portfolio in 30 years. 

# General information about the analysis
